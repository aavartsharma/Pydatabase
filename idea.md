this project is for my database which will be storing all my data like microconstrole and all that stuff this mean that this sqlite database will have data i don't want to get lost and come in someone's hand but i want it commmuntcte with my device and script and app so 

so i will have a api that will give access to the run query in the database the api will be for my pybase which work like a kernal that will create protection layer for the database then i will use that api to use it in my main libary like syslink's of python or javascript or any other languge to commictate every app or script connect to the pybase framework will have a name and unqui password and i will be ask to allow that client can make request to the database or not if yes than okay other wise request will be denined

the pybase framwork will connect with client with a url HTTps.shomething which will saved in envirment variable in the main machine no client will have location of dataabse expect pybase, the data written to database will be encryted so that no one can read it's constent

the qury's will be stored too to database in a new table 

each clinet will have a perminteila level this will allow the commend they can use in database like eather only read , write data to a table,write and rewrite data of a table 
alter the table and 

the app will be logged for any error and this pybase will have ui interface eather with three.js or python or electron.js in all opition there will be a password which will prevent unauthorized login this app will show data about databse and all it compontet, well i can make a web interface to with the backend of pybase

the api call can only be avaiable through local netowork like wifi and should not be exposed to internet for now

this app will run via my other project all pysehchal os there which will intaliex the python app

correction in detail.md
1.) 47. even table name and it's column name should be encryped
2.)
